The bitter cold of the early morning wind outside the Zimpoen office did nothing to dampen my spirits. For it was the 14th of February, 2013 - a day that will forever be etched in my memory as the most joyous day of my life. A day that marked the realization of a lifelong dream as His Majesty the King graciously granted me the gift of Bhutanese citizenship. Even ten years later, the warmth of that moment still lingers in my heart, filling me with gratitude and a sense of belonging. It was a day that changed my life forever, and one that I will always hold dear.

I had just finished class 12, and without citizenship kidu, I knew that I had no chance at securing the coveted government scholarship. As soon as I found out that I had done pretty well in the board examination, I remembered that a man identifying himself as from the Zimpoen office, had come to my home town of Gelephu, right after my class 10 results, assuring me that if I did well again in class 12, I would be taken care of as far as citizenship and college were concerned. Thus, I decided to seek kidu from the royal secretariat.

I will always remember the overwhelming sense of despair and uncertainty that consumed me as I walked through the doors of the Zimpoen office day after day. Despite this, I remained determined and persistent in my visits, desperate for any sign of hope for my uncertain future. The burden of uncertainty was heavy on my shoulders, and I couldn't shake the feeling that my future was slipping away. In the face of such adversity, I refused to give up on the hope that one day, my turn would come and my future would be secure.

On the eve of Valentine's Day, my heart was filled with a mix of emotions. I was about to lay my head down to rest when my phone suddenly rang. When I answered, a court official's voice filled my ears and my heart skipped a beat with elation - His Majesty would grant me an audience the next day. As I hung up the phone, my heart raced with excitement and anticipation. I was informed that I would need to arrive early the following morning, and before I went into his presence, I would be taught the formalities of the court. The day had finally arrived, and my heart was filled with joy and gratefulness as I prepared to meet my king.

As the bitter wind howled outside the Zimpoen office, I felt a chill run down my spine. Reflecting on that fateful day, I am convinced that it was not just the cold that made me shiver, but the overwhelming anxiety that consumed me as I prepared to meet the king of my beloved country, where I had lived for the past 18 years. The nerves were overwhelming and palpable as I stood outside the office, unsure of what the future held. 

It was probably an hour before an attendant showed up and inquired why I was there so early, to which I responded accordingly. As more and more people started to streak in, a man came out and asked me to come inside. I was then given a crash course on proper Driglam Namzha and the customary gestures. I was ready to meet the king.

At about 8 am, I was taken to the Lingkana Palace, the humble but elegant abode of our beloved king. The palace may not be grand or imposing, but it exudes a charm and elegance that make it truly special. As I walked through the palace's gardens, I couldn't help but feel a sense of peace and tranquility. No sooner was I taking in the simplicity of the grounds, I was offered tea which I sipped hastily, for want of a better grasp of the things that were happening around me. I was told that the Royal Kukhors and the distinguished dignitaries would also arrive at the palace to bid farewell and pay respects to his majesty before he embarked upon his journey to Bangladesh.

As they walked through the palace gates and made their way towards the path that leads to the humble structure that is the Lingkana palace, I felt a sense of awe wash over me. I couldn't believe that I was in the presence of so many important figures. It left me feeling both humbled and honored. All the dignitaries started lining up to bid farewell to the king, who was on his way to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Bangladesh's Independence in Dhaka.

As I stood in gratitude at my good fortune, the royal ride came in, and to my utter surprise, His Majesty the King stepped out of the car. My heart skipped a beat as I realized that I was about to meet the King in person. I couldn't believe my luck; it felt like a dream come true.
After he bid everyone farewell, just as he was about to get back in his car, he caught sight of me and started making his way towards where I was. As he walked towards me, I felt a sense of nervousness and excitement. Immediately, I paid my respects by bowing deeply. I could feel the weight of his presence and the importance of the moment, and as he approached me with a warm smile, I felt my nerves start to dissipate.

He greeted me with kind words and assured me that all my problems, including the issue preventing me from getting scholarships, would be taken care of. I couldn't believe that the King of Bhutan was taking the time to talk to me, a simple visitor. I felt incredibly honored and humbled as he spoke to me. 

Meeting His Majesty was a moment that will forever be etched in my memory. The warmth and kindness emanating from him were truly palpable and left a profound impact on me. I felt incredibly blessed to have been given the opportunity to meet such a remarkable leader, one who exuded genuine compassion and understanding. The experience was truly unforgettable, and I will always treasure it as one of the most valuable moments of my life.

As I reflect on the last 10 years and the journey that has brought me to where I am today, I am filled with deep gratitude and emotion. The opportunity to study in the United States on a Fulbright scholarship was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience that has shaped me in immeasurable ways. Now, as a Strategy Officer at Bhutan National Bank, I am honored to be able to give back to my country and work towards improving the bank's services through technology. Every day as I gaze upon the image of His Majesty on the side of my desk, I am reminded of the incredible good fortune that has brought me to this point in my life, and I am filled with immense gratitude for the opportunities and experiences that have shaped me into who I am today.
