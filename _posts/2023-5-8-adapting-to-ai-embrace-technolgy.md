It is evident that the educational landscape must change as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more pervasive in everyday life. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionise education in the same way that the internet democratised access to information. New problems, such as plagiarism that is generated by AI, are emerging as a result of this change. If we want to successfully integrate AI tools into higher education, we need to figure out how to keep tabs on students' learning styles and habits over the course of their college careers.

Monitoring a student's style and trends is vital for spotting any substantial differences that may suggest AI-generated plagiarism at any level of schooling, from pre-primary to graduate. It would be much easier for schools to evaluate student work submissions for uniformity of style, vocabulary use, and other distinguishing features if all of that information were stored in one place. This will allow teachers to anticipate instances of content generated by AI and prepare lessons accordingly.

The goal of integrating AI tools into higher education should be to encourage innovative uses of these cutting-edge technology rather than simply to monitor and prohibit dishonest use. Teachers should be open to the ways in which AI might help them tailor lessons to individual students, increase participation, and get useful insights into their students' strengths and limitations. This will allow schools to better equip their kids with the skills they need to succeed in an increasingly AI-dominated future.

Interestingly, this essay itself is a demonstration of how AI has the capacity to convey a writer's meaning precisely. It's an example of how AI can be used to supplement human cognition and creativity. AI, when accepted and tailored to suit educational needs, has the potential to improve teaching and learning and better prepare students for the opportunities and difficulties of a globally interconnected and technologically advanced future.

Thus, integrating AI into any level ofÂ education requires finding middle ground between capitalising on AI's transformative potential and jeopardising academic rigour. The power of AI may be used to improve education in a way that protects students' academic integrity and promotes genuine intellectual growth by monitoring students' learning habits and promoting creative adaptability.
