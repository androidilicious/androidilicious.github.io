The stretch of expressway that starts from Thimphu Welcome Gate in Babesa and ends at the Lungtenzampa bridge is currently laden with 8 speed bumps. While they were originally intended to control accidents on the newly inaugurated high-speed lane, there are now better ways to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians while also saving costs in terms of fuel and government expenditure. 

## **Experiment**

The stretch of road is precisely 8 km long from the Four Friends Junction to the Lungtenzampa bridge. At a speed limit of 50 km per hour, this stretch of road should take a law-abiding driver approximately 10 minutes to traverse. However, due to the presence of speed bumps and resulting traffic, it currently takes no less than 15 minutes to travel the same distance.

## **Consequences**

While the speed bumps do discourage people from traveling at excessive speeds, the lost time and extra fuel consumption over time are costly for both drivers and the state. Any obstacles on a highway that limit drivers from traveling at an optimal speed, such as bumps or potholes, can be expensive for vehicle owners. The state must ensure that roads are playable at an optimal speed without any hindrances for drivers.

## **Recommendation**

AI object recognition technology can be implemented on the expressway to discourage any undesirable driver behavior that speed bumps are intended to deter. Cameras could be placed at regular intervals along the entire length of the highway to continuously monitor vehicle speeds. The system could be designed to:

- Take a photograph of the number plate when a car exceeds the predefined speed limit, recognize the owner of the vehicle from the ERALIS system maintained by the RSTA, and immediately notify the owner of the violation through either the MRSTA app or an SMS.
- Provide the owner with three warnings for similar errors, following which a fine could be imposed.
- Develop pedestrian walkways along the entire stretch.

## **Conclusion**

While speed bumps play an important role in reducing accidents on the expressway, there are now better options available to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians. The implementation of AI object recognition technology can discourage drivers from exceeding speed limits, resulting in improved safety and cost savings for both drivers and the state.
