## Introduction
[Bhutan National Bank](http://www.bnb.bt "Bhutan National Bank") (BNB) is one of Bhutan's largest banks, with a vast network of branches and a sizable client base. For a long time, the bank has been operating without a ticketing system, resulting in poor customer service and low customer satisfaction reviews. Problems and complaints were manually recorded on spreadsheets, resulting in delays and no 'closure of issue loops.' The bank's management saw the need of implementing a ticketing system that would offer a consolidated platform for problem monitoring and administration, as well as efficient customer support via the contact center.

After careful consideration, BNB decided to implement [Zammad](https://zammad.com// "Zammad"), an open-source ticketing tool that is highly customizable and efficient in issue tracking and management. The project was spearheaded by the Strategy Management Department (SMD) of BNB, which had the necessary expertise and mandate in software exploration and recommendations. This case study provides a detailed account of the implementation process, the benefits of the system, and the impact on the bank's operations and customer service.

## Implementation Process
The implementation process of Zammad started with a thorough analysis of the bank's requirements and needs. The SMD team carried out a detailed assessment of the existing system and identified the areas where the ticketing system could bring significant improvements. The team also held discussions with relevant stakeholders, including the management, staff, and customers, to ensure that the system would meet everyone's needs.

Based on the requirements analysis, we customized the Zammad software to suit the bank's specific needs. The team created different user roles, including the administrators, agents, incharges, and customers. The team also customized the ticket form to include all the necessary fields, such as the ticket type, priority, category, department, and description. The system was integrated with email and SMS, allowing customers to raise and notify about the issues via these channels.

We then conducted training sessions for the staff to familiarize them with the new system. The training covered the use of the ticketing system, including ticket creation, assignment, and closure. The team also provided training on the use of the system's reporting tools, which could be used to generate reports on the status of tickets, the performance of agents, and customer satisfaction levels.

## Benefits of the System

The implementation of Zammad has brought numerous benefits to BNB. The system has streamlined the bank's issue tracking and management processes, leading to faster resolution times and improved customer satisfaction levels. The system has also improved the bank's operational efficiency, leading to cost savings.

### Improved Customer Service

The ticketing system has provided a centralized platform for issue tracking and management. Customers can raise issues via email, SMS, or the online ticket form, which are automatically routed to the relevant and available agent. The system has also introduced a system of closure of tickets, which ensures that all issues are resolved and closed as per Service Level Agreements we have put in place. Customers are notified via email or SMS when their issues are resolved or closed, ensuring transparency and accountability.

The system has also introduced a mechanism for customer feedback. After the resolution of a ticket, customers are requested to rate their satisfaction with the service provided. To that end, we use a simple google form with a scale that ranges form 0 through 10. The system generates reports on customer satisfaction levels, which are used to identify areas of improvement and enhance the customer experience. 

### Operational Efficiency

The ticketing system has improved the bank's operational efficiency by providing a centralized platform for issue tracking and management. The system has automated the process of ticket assignment, reducing the time and effort required to assign tickets manually. The system has also introduced a system of priority levels, which ensures that urgent issues are given priority over less urgent ones. The system generates reports on the performance of agents, which are used to identify areas of improvement and enhance the productivity of the bank's staff. 

### Cost Savings

The implementation of Zammad has led to significant cost savings for BNB. The bank had previously considered implementing an SAP system proposed by a local firm, which would have cost Nu. 10 million. However, the implementation of Zammad cost a fraction of that amount, as it is an open-source tool that can be customized and adapted to meet the bank's specific needs. The cost savings have allowed the bank to invest in other areas of its operations, improving the overall efficiency of the bank.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

The implementation of Zammad was not without its challenges. The main challenge was the resistance to change among some of the bank's staff. The new system required staff to adopt new processes and ways of working, which some found difficult to adjust to. We had to provide extensive training and support to help staff familiarize themselves with the new system. 

Another challenge was the customization of the software. While Zammad is highly customizable, the we had to spend significant time and effort to ensure that the system met the bank's specific needs. The customization process required a deep understanding of the bank's operations and requirements, which was time-consuming and required expertise. 

The implementation of Zammad has taught BNB some valuable lessons. One of the key lessons is the importance of involving all stakeholders in the implementation process. By consulting with management, staff, and customers, the bank was able to identify its specific requirements and ensure that the system met everyone's needs. Another lesson is the importance of training and support. We had to provide extensive training and support to help staff adjust to the new system, which was essential to the success of the implementation.

## Conclusion

The implementation of Zammad at Bhutan National Bank has brought significant benefits to the bank, including improved customer service, operational efficiency, and cost savings. The system has streamlined the bank's issue tracking and management processes, leading to faster resolution times and improved customer satisfaction levels. The system has also introduced a mechanism for customer feedback, which is used to identify areas of improvement and enhance the customer experience. The implementation process was not without its challenges, but the bank was able to overcome them through extensive training and support. Overall, the implementation of Zammad has been a success, and the bank is now better equipped to serve its customers efficiently and effectively.
