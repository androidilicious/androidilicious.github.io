It is understood in Bhutan that a civil servant or anybody that has a full time job, is not allowed to operate a business for ethical reasons. What is also however quite apparant is the complete disregard for this rule. From taxi drivers to the shopkeepers, you will often find civil servants partaking in a second job. This phenomenon can be partly attributed to the fact that it is not enough to sustain a family with the pay that people receive in most of the career positions.

### Does this rule even make sense?

Almost all governments across the globe have a regulation prohibiting civil officials from doing any other business. This is primarily because of what is often termed as 'conflict of interest'. Since a civil servant derives his or her salary from the taxes that citizens pay and is expected to avoid external business transactions and commitments, it is mandated of the government employee to provide service and not extract profit from the citizens. 

What if, on the other hand, the business that a government employee chooses to engage in has no bearing on the official tasks that he or she is required to do for the public? An architect who builds government facilities, for example, could decide to open an electronics store to supplement his income. 

Wouldn't it make sense to bring it to a deciding committee in circumstances when there is no conflict of interest, so that such ventures may be evaluated before the employee is authorized to start the business?

### What makes sense?

Rather than imposing a blanket rule prohibiting all public employees from engaging in business activities, the government should establish an Office of Ethics, which would be in charge of not only screening potential business ventures proposed by civil servants, but also advising government institutions on how to make ethical decisions. I don't see why it would be a terrible idea to enable public officials to participate in private business ventures if there are checks in place such as periodic financial disclosures and audits.
