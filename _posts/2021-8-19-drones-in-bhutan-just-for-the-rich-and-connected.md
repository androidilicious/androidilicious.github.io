Update: Import of drones in Bhutan is prohibited unless you are a government agency.

Flying drones in Bhutan as a recreational and creative activity is a prohibited affair. One can't simply purchase a drone and go about flying it outside. Of course, many responsible governments have seen to it that drones are registered before use, which I think should also be done in Bhutan (and is already being done). What is the most irritating aspect of the entire fiasco is the way authorities make it so difficult to fly the drone.

In Bhutan, drones are any aircraft that are piloted remotely. They are also known as UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) or RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems).

If you have fallen for those beautiful scenic shots online, you might well know by now that those were mostly captured by the systems under discussion here today, the unobtainable drone. If you want one, there's a whole list of rules you have to follow; let's go one by one.

You have to first invest a decent amount of money on a drone which you will probably order from sites like Amazon or AliExpress. Once it reaches you, you have to fill up the registration form and submit it to the Bhutan Civil Aviation Authority (BCAA) in Paro Airport, which will set you back a modest sum of Nu. 500.

Once you are done with the registration, comes the fateful day of flying your beloved drone. Or should I say, the fateful week for it is about the length of time it will take you to get permits from relevant agencies for maiden flight (If everything goes well and you are a government agency (which probably you are not)). You also need to get approval and clearances from the organizations such as BCAA, MOHCA, BICMA, RBP, RBA, and 'other agencies' as required. What it means by other agencies is up to the guardians of these mighty drone laws.

If you are one of those lucky enough to get the necessary clearances from these institutions, welcome to the next level where you have to prove your competence and talent in piloting these flying objects. If you are one of those that recently purchased a drone to just fly as a hobby or film some awesome shots for your YouTube, you are out of luck because it is impossible for you to obtain 'documentary evidence' to prove to the relevant agencies that you can indeed fly. So Good Luck!

You can find similar limitations [https://www.tourism.gov.bt/uploads/attachment_files/x3Yt_tcb_042916_notice.pdf](here) in the notification published by BCAA which is a slap in the face telling you to not fly.

For the record, all of our neighboring countries have sane drone laws as can be referenced below. Ours is the only absurd one.
