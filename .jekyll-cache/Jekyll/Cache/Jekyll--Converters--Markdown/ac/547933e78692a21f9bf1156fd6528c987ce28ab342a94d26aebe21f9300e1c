<p>The second lockdown or lockdown 2.0 as it is fancily called, began on 20th December and is still going on as I write this. It was initially projected to go on for at least 3 weeks, given the gestation period of the virus in a human body. However, we are onto our fourth week of lockdown with no end in sight. Just yesterday, there was a case from the community as one of the shopkeepers tested positive as he was due to open his shop. This points to the ongoing community transmission which is obviously unchecked.</p>
